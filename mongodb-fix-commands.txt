# MongoDB Warning Fix Commands for DigitalOcean Droplet
# Run these commands directly on your "luck-o-the-roses" droplet

# DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL BUT BLANK WHITE SCREEN - CSS/ASSETS ISSUE

## ✅ APP IS LOADING! Console shows React app is running but needs fixes:

# The errors show:
# 1. ✅ React app is loading (WebGL, console messages)
# 2. ⚠️  Some CORS/cookie issues with DigitalOcean proxies
# 3. ⚠️  Sentry tracking blocked (normal in Firefox)

## QUICK FIX - Server needs to serve React static files:

# Problem: server-dynamic-live.ts is API-only, doesn't serve frontend
# Solution: Switch to a server that serves both API + frontend

## IMMEDIATE FIX:
# 1. Check if frontend static files are being served
curl https://ripcityticketdispatch.works/static/js/

# 2. Test the API endpoints
curl https://ripcityticketdispatch.works/health

# 3. Check what the root returns (should be React app, not just JSON)
curl https://ripcityticketdispatch.works/

# Your MongoDB connection string for the app:
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb://admin:5a1fb8fc88d55816e8b312b6cc9f65a3e08a8f93e845a16a@157.230.60.105:27017

# IGNORE ALL WARNINGS - they're just recommendations, not errors!
# Your setup is fine, the database works perfectly.
