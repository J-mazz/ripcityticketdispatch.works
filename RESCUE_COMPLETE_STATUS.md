# 🚀 Rip City Ticket Dispatch - RESCUE MISSION COMPLETE ✅

## 📋 **MISSION SUMMARY**
Successfully rescued and restored the broken Rip City Ticket Dispatch repository to a fully deployable state after critical sabotage by another agent.

---

## 🔧 **CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED**

### 🏗️ **Build System Issues - FIXED**
- ✅ **Fixed Procfile**: Changed from `node src/server.js` → `node dist/server.js`
- ✅ **Removed conflicting files**: Deleted outdated JavaScript `server.js` that conflicted with TypeScript version
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation**: All builds now complete successfully
- ✅ **Import resolution**: Fixed Express type extensions to compile properly

### 🗃️ **Backend Infrastructure - RESTORED**
- ✅ **Server stability**: No more crashes, runs continuously on port 8080
- ✅ **API endpoints**: All routes responding correctly
- ✅ **Multi-source integration**: Ticketmaster + Eventbrite aggregation working
- ✅ **Deal scoring system**: Advanced algorithm operational
- ✅ **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing API keys

### 💳 **Payment System - CONFIGURED**
- ✅ **Stripe integration**: Updated to use correct environment variable `STRIPE_SECRET`
- ✅ **Graceful degradation**: Payment features disabled when secret key missing (expected)
- ✅ **Environment setup**: Proper variable structure in place
