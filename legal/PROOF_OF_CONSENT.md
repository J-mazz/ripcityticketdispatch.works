**Document Version**: 1.1  
**Date**: 2025-06-13  
**Service**: Rip City Events Hub  
**Company**: Rip City Ticket Dispatch LLC

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the procedures and mechanisms Rip City Events Hub employs to obtain and manage user consent for its SMS (Short Message Service) alert feature. This documentation serves as a reference for compliance with applicable regulations and best practices regarding text message communications, reflecting the implementation within the `J-mazz/ripcityticketdispatch.works` repository.

## 2. SMS Program Description

*   **Program Name**: Rip City Events Hub SMS Alerts
*   **Purpose**: To provide users with real-time event deal alerts, information on ticket value propositions, and critical service notifications related to their Rip City Events Hub account and preferences.
*   **Message Types**:
    *   Event Deal Alerts: Notifications about sports events, music events, and entertainment based on user-configured preferences. Examples include Flash Deals, Price Drops, New Events, and Last Chance warnings.
    *   Service Notifications: Important updates regarding the user's account, subscription, or significant changes to the Service.
*   **Target Audience**: Registered users of Rip City Events Hub on eligible subscription tiers (Pro, Premium, Enterprise) who explicitly opt-in to receive SMS alerts.

## 3. User Opt-In Process

Users must provide explicit, affirmative consent (opt-in), including a double opt-in confirmation, before any SMS messages are sent.

### 3.1. Methods of Opt-In:

1.  **During Subscription Upgrade/Account Settings**:
    *   When a user upgrades to an eligible subscription tier (Pro, Premium, or Enterprise) or modifies their notification preferences, the SMS consent process is initiated.
    *   This is handled by frontend components such as `SMSConsent.tsx` and integrated within `SubscriptionSettings.tsx`.

### 3.2. User Action for Consent (Multi-Step Process):

1.  **Initial Consent & Phone Number Submission**:
    *   The user manually enters their mobile phone number in the designated field within the `SMSConsent.tsx` component.
    *   The user must actively select checkboxes indicating their agreement to receive SMS alerts and their acceptance of the Rip City Events Hub Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
2.  **Double Opt-In SMS Verification**:
    *   Upon submission, the backend (`smsConsentService.ts` via `POST /api/sms-consent/opt-in`) validates the phone number (including checking if it's a mobile number via Twilio Lookup) and sends an SMS containing a 6-digit verification code to the provided number.
    *   The SMS message template used is: `ðŸŒ¹ Rip City Events Hub: Confirm SMS alerts by replying with code: {CODE}\n\nMsg&data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt-out.\nTerms: ripcityticketdispatch.works/terms` (or similar, as defined in `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_SMS_READY.md`).
3.  **Confirmation Code Entry**:
    *   The user enters the received 6-digit code into the confirmation interface provided by `SMSConsent.tsx`.
    *   This code is submitted to the `POST /api/sms-consent/confirm` endpoint.
4.  **Consent Activation**:
    *   If the code is valid, the `double_opt_in_confirmed` status is updated in the `sms_consent` database table, and SMS alerts are activated for the user.

### 3.3. Consent Language Example (Displayed in `SMSConsent.tsx`):

The following (or substantially similar) language is displayed to the user at the point of initial consent:

```
By providing your mobile phone number and checking this box, you agree to receive text message alerts from Rip City Events Hub regarding event deals, price drops, and important service notifications.

Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. You can opt out at any time by replying STOP to any message. For help, reply HELP.

By clicking "Enable SMS Alerts," you consent to receive automated text messages at the phone number provided. Consent is not a condition of purchase.

You also agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which describe how we collect, use, and protect your information.
```

## 4. Data Collection and Storage

### 4.1. Information Collected:

*   **Phone Number**: The mobile phone number provided by the user.
*   **Consent Timestamp**: The date and time when consent was initially provided.

### 4.2. Database Storage:

All consent data is stored in the `sms_consent` table within the Rip City Events Hub database, as defined in `ripcity-backend/src/database/connection.ts`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sms_consent (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  phone_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  consent_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  opt_out_timestamp TIMESTAMP NULL,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  subscription_tier VARCHAR(20),
  double_opt_in_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  double_opt_in_code VARCHAR(10),
  double_opt_in_sent_at TIMESTAMP,
  double_opt_in_confirmed_at TIMESTAMP,
  source VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'web_app',

);
```

## 5. Opt-Out Mechanisms

Users can opt out of SMS alerts through multiple methods:

### 5.1. Reply STOP:

*   Users can reply with "STOP," "UNSUBSCRIBE," "CANCEL," "END," or "QUIT" to any SMS message.

*   An opt-out confirmation message is sent: "You've been unsubscribed from Rip City Events Hub SMS alerts. No more messages will be sent to this number."

### 5.2. Web Interface:

*   Users can manually opt out through their account settings via the `SMSConsent.tsx` component.
*   This uses the `POST /api/sms-consent/opt-out` endpoint.

### 5.3. Processing Time:
